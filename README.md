- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @itspratham10! I'm passionate about sports and love staying active. When I'm not coding, you can find me on the field or court, playing my favorite sports. Currently, I'm exploring new programming languages and sharpening my skills. I'm open to collaborating on exciting projects and exchanging knowledge. You can reach me through direct messages here.
